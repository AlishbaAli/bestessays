        2) intentionally indicated an incorrect information.</p>
        <p><b>4. Order Process</b></p>
        <p>4. 1. Placing an Order. When filling in an Order form, it is the sole responsibility of the Customer to register
        using a valid email address and to provide a correct phone number where the Customer can be reached (preferably
        both - home and mobile). There may be multiple occasions during Order preparation when establishing contact with
        the Customer is crucial. Failure to provide a valid email address or a correct phone number may affect Order
        completion and will result in a violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This may lead to
        forfeiture of any claim to the implied warranty or guarantee by the Customer.</p>
        <p>4. 2. Payment. The Company cannot begin working on the Customer's Order until the Customer has paid for the entire amount of
        the Product(s) and/or service(s). The Company is not liable or responsible for the failure of a Customer to pay
        on time. </p>
        <p>4. 3. Discounts. The Customer must be precise and attentive when filling in the Order form. A discount code can't be applied to an order after Order has been paid.

Special offers or discounts on the Company's Products and services may not be used together at the same time and cannot be combined with any additional services.</p>
        <p>4. 4. Instructions. Because the Company works based on Customer’s instructions, these instructions must be clear
        and precise. If the instructions are not clear and additional instructions are needed to complete the Order, but
        are not provided within the required time schedule, the Company cannot fulfill any implied warranty or guarantee
        and it shall not be held responsible. The Customer is advised that once the Order is completed any revision
        request must only be based on the initial requirements and description of the original Order. Any changes from
        the initial instructions of the Order will be considered "editing". This is an additional service and the
        Company will not conduct any free revision request that is different or deviates from the original Order
        requirements and/or description. Instructions and additional requests must be sent before a Writer is assigned
        to the Customer’s Order. Failure to meet this requirement will result in a violation of this Agreement and
        forfeiture of any claim to the implied warranty or guarantee.</p>
        <p>4. 5. Sources. The Writer is allowed to use any relevant source available for the completion of the requested
        assignment - books, journals, newspapers, interviews, online publications etc., unless the Customer mentions
        some particular sources to be used or others to be ignored. If the Customer needs specific sources that are
        crucial for the completion of the Order, the Company would expect the Customer to provide them within the
        required time schedule listed below.</p>
        <p>48 hours - 10 days: Instructions and all sources must be received within the first 8 hours.</p>
        <p>12 hours - 24 hours: Instructions and all sources must be received within the first 1 hour.</p>

        <p>Failure to do so will result in a violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and forfeiture of any
        claim to the implied warranty or guarantee.</p>
        <p>4. 6. Matching of the Academic Level. In the event that the desired academic level chosen by the Customer is the
        improper academic/quality level (either by accident or not), the Customer shall assume all liability for such
        error. It shall be the Customer’s sole responsibility to choose the correct academic level that best fits the
        required assignment at the time of making the Order. If the Customer has made an error while placing an Order,
        then the Customer must contact the Support Team immediately for assistance.</p>
        <p>4. 7. Checking the Messaging System. The Messaging System is an easy and convenient way to communicate. The
        Customer should check messages for any updates from the Support Team or from the Writer. The Customer should
        also promptly address any questions, concerns or give additional instructions using this interactive feature.
        Failure or neglect to check the Messaging System shall not be sufficient ground for a refund of services
        rendered. If the Customer does not know how to use the Messaging System, the Customer may contact the Support
        Team at any time for assistance or instructions.</p>
        <p>4. 8. Incorrect Order Placement. The Company reserves the right not to process or to resubmit the Customer’s
        Order in the event that the details indicated are inconsistent to or do not match the Order's original
        description. Failure to provide the correct description or choosing the wrong Product, deadline extension
        requests or Writer level upgrade may require additional payments. Please note this is done by the Company only
        so that it may properly process the Customer’s Order and have the best possible Writer to complete the
        Customer’s Order. The Customer will always be contacted to approve any additional charges or requests.
        <p>4. 9. Tracking Order Progress. The Customer is highly encouraged to stay in touch with the Support Team/Writer
        and to monitor Order Progress through the Customer’s personal account on the web site. Possible statuses of the
        order are:</p>
        <p>Awaiting payment – albeit the Order is registered within the Company’s system, the Customer should proceed with
        the payment first for the Company start working on it.</p>

        the Customer’s personal account on the web site.</p>
        <p>Returned for revision – Writer is revising the Product according to Customer’s instructions.</p>
        <p>Hold – the Order is put on hold by the Support Team and the Writer has temporarily stopped working on it. The
        Customer is advised to visit Messaging board on the personal profile for detailed information or to contact the
        Support Team.</p>
        <p>Canceled – the Order is canceled.</p>
        <p>4. 10. Client can request for a draft from Writer, however, the Company does not guarantee a draft if Order's
        urgency is 3-48 hours.</p>
        <p>4. 11. Preferred Writer. When placing an Order, the Customer can indicate a preferred Writer to be assigned to an
        Order. The Company reserves the right to decline preferred Writer request based on Writer's history, recent
        quality and lateness issues that might jeopardize Order completion. The Company will inform Customer about it's
        decision and provide supporting materials. If the Customer insists on chosen Writer, the Company will not be
        responsible for failure of the preferred Writer to deliver high quality Product in a timely manner. No refund
        can be guaranteed at that point.</p>
        <p><b>5. Delivery/Downloading Policy</b></p>
        <p>5. 1. The Company strives for the highest level of satisfaction available. However, the Company cannot and will
        not be held liable or responsible for any type of delivery issues resulting from problems such as spam filters,
        incorrect email, lack of internet access or general neglect, among others, which are beyond its control and/or
        without its fault. The Support Team is available 24 hours a day to assist the Customer with any delivery
        problems of the Order. The Company will do its best to meet the Customer’s academic writing needs by maintaining
        up-to-date software. However, it is the sole responsibility of the Customer to provide the correct contact
        information to the Company.</p>

        to download the Product. Please note that the Customer will still be billed for the service rendered and no

        <p>6. 1. Protecting billing information of the Customers and eliminating fraud is a priority that the Company takes
        seriously. The Company is obliged by authorities along with merchant providers and banks to protect the credit
