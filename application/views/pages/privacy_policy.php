<h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>We collect two kinds of information related to you: (a) Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"); and (b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("Non-PII").</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information:  PII includes any information that identifies you as person.   We gather your PII when you make the choice to register with us or when you select to participate in an interactive feature of our Sites such as a review, survey or promotion.   You may:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card number and phone number when registering with our Sites or in connection with a contest entry;</li>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">provide certain demographic information about you (e.g., age, gender, shopping interests and preferences, etc.) when participating in a survey or poll; or</li>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:   We accumulate certain non-PII from you when you visit our Site including IP addresses and information relating to your browser, operating system, ISP, the third party website from which your visit originated and your utilization of our Sites specific to the web pages you visit, and the extent of your visits.</p>
<h2>HOW WE USE & SHARE THE INFORMATION</h2>
<p>In our effort to constantly improve our services, your PII and Non-PII are a critical part in our fulfilling your requests, responding to your inquiries, serving you better in general, and understanding your needs. We also use this data in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the information.</p>
<p>We may disclose PII and Non-PII to:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">our third party service vendors who host and manage data, process credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, etc;</li>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">our parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated companies (" affiliated companies") for operational, marketing and promotional purposes;</li>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">co-promotional partnering companies and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships ;</li>
    <li style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;">our other users where you make the choice to publicly post reviews, comments or other information in relation to products or services, communicate with other users via public forums (e.g., forums, message boards, bulletin boards, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequently, we use non-PII to assist in analyzing site traffic, understanding customer requests and trends, initiating targeted promotional activities (see "Preference Based Advertising" below).</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>At Essaysrus.ca we diligently work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you provide. Additionally, we also use a secure and dependable server hosting location in the US, firewall protection, controlled access and encryption technology to protect your data.   Please be advised that although we strive to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and take no responsibility for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your PII.   In the regrettable event that your personal information which identifies you is in any way compromised, we will notify you directly via e-mail at the last known e-mail address you have provided us with as soon as feasibly possible under the circumstances (delays in notification may occur while we take necessary steps to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system, as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.)</p>
